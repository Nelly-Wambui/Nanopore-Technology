## INTRODUCTION TO THE DNA SEQUENCING TECHNOLOGIES

The Human Genome Project set out to determine all the 3 billion nucleotides
in the human genome.

There have been some generations of techniques over the years that have made it possible to improve 
the sequencing of DNA.

Initially, the methods used in sequencing of proteins could not be applied in sequencing of DNA 
because DNA was longer and were made of fewer yet similar units making it really difficult to
distinguish between the units. RNA sequencing preceded DNA sequencing as they were not complicated by
having complimentary strands and were much shorter
